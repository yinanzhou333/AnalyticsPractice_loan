Our study's objective is to enhance our understanding of borrower profiles and determine the most predictive factors for loan defaults. 
To achieve this, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using histograms, boxplots, bar charts, and correlation matrix to observe the dataset's distribution.

Additionally, we performed hypothesis testing and built various models, including a generalized linear model (GLM), stepwise regression model, and lasso regression model, to identify the best fit for this dataset. 
We also utilized confusion matrices, ROC curves, and AUC to evaluate the performance of our models.

Through our analysis, we not only reveal the characteristics of individuals more likely to default but also offer strategic insights. 
These insights can guide the development of more effective lending practices, tailored to mitigate risks, and foster financial reliability. 
By understanding the underlying patterns and predictors of loan defaults, our aim is to support lenders in making informed decisions that enhance the overall stability and sustainability of financial institutions.
